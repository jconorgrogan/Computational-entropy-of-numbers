2. Instruction Set
We define the following instruction set:

Opcodes (2 bits)
00: Output Operand1 (Operand2 is ignored)
01: Add Operand1 and Operand2
10: Multiply Operand1 and Operand2
11: Bitwise AND of Operand1 and Operand2
Operands (2 bits each)
Can represent values from 0 to 3 (binary 00 to 11)
3. Enumerating All Programs and Their Outputs
We'll analyze each opcode separately.

Opcode 00: Output Operand1
Total Programs: 16 (since Operand1 and Operand2 each have 4 possible values)
Operation: Output the value of Operand1

4	0	3	1	0	4
5	0	2	0	0	2
6	0	1	2	0	3
9	0	0	1	0	1
Note: Outputs 7, 8 are not produced by any program in this configuration.


With the 6-bit programs and the specified instruction set, the number of programs producing each output is:

Output 0: 21 programs
Output 1: 10 programs
Output 2: 12 programs
Output 3: 11 programs
Output 4: 4 programs
Output 5: 2 programs
Output 6: 3 programs
Output 9: 1 program
