First Layer: Minimal Programs
This layer includes the simplest programs that perform basic operations like writing binary digits, performing additions, or executing simple multiplications. These are the initial "direct" computations without identity transformations.

Program Summary:
- Programs generating 0: 1 program (e.g., directly writing "00").
- Programs generating 1: 4 programs (e.g., writing "01," adding 1 + 0, multiplying 1 * 1).
- Programs generating 2: 3 programs (e.g., writing "10," adding 1 + 1, multiplying 2 * 1).
- Programs generating 3: 1 program (e.g., writing "11").
- Programs generating 4: 1 program (e.g., multiplying 2 * 2).

Program Count for First Layer:
| Binary Output | Decimal Equivalent | Number of Programs |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 00            | 0                  | 1                  |
| 01            | 1                  | 4                  |
| 10            | 2                  | 3                  |
| 11            | 3                  | 1                  |
| 100           | 4                  | 1                  |

Second Layer: Identity Programs
This layer applies identity transformations like adding 0, multiplying by 1, or logical conditions that yield the same output. These transformations generate more distinct programs for each number, increasing the computational entropy.

Program Summary After Identity Transformations:
- Programs generating 0: 3 distinct programs (including "0 + 0", "0 * 1").
- Programs generating 1: 6 distinct programs (including "1 + 0", "1 * 1", if-else conditions).
- Programs generating 2: 5 distinct programs (including "1 + 1 + 0", "2 * 1 + 0").
- Programs generating 3: 3 distinct programs (including looping logic or redundant conditions).
- Programs generating 4: 2 distinct programs (expanding through simple transformations).

Program Count for Second Layer:

| 00            | 0                  | 3                                  |
| 01            | 1                  | 6                                  |

| 11            | 3                  | 3                                  |
| 100           | 4                  | 2                                  |
